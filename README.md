## How to play ?

You can move by using `ZQSD` keys and jump by using the `Space bar`.

You can interact with many things by using the `E` key.

To open the inventory you should use the `I` key and to open the quest journal the `J` key.

By using the `Escape` key you should be able to open the pause menu in game.

To fast save your game, you just have to press `F5`.
